Theater is written as a script for performance, structured into acts and scenes. It consists primarily of character dialogue, stage directions, and minimal narration. Characters speak in turns, revealing plot and emotion through action and conversation rather than descriptive prose. Stage directions describe movement, tone, or setting.
