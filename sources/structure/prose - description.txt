Prose is continuous, paragraph-based writing without formal meter or rhyme. It follows natural speech patterns and focuses on narrative flow, character development, and logical progression of ideas. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and the structure typically relies on chapters or sections. Prose can include narration, dialogue, internal thoughts, and descriptive passages.
