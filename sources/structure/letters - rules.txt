Begin with a greeting (e.g., “Dear X,”).
Write in the first person unless deliberately stylized.
Use a clear narrative flow: introduction → purpose → closing thoughts.
Maintain the tone appropriate for sender–recipient relationship.
Include a closing signature (“Yours,” “Sincerely,” etc.).
Allow emotional expression and direct address (“you”).
Avoid overly technical structuring; keep it conversational or formal depending on intent.
